src
  Distribution.hs (general distribution funcs)
  Distributions   (dir for all specific distributions)
    -- parameterized type constructors and
       instance declarations for various type classes
    Normal.hs
    Binomial.hs
\end{verbatim}

The notion of ``distributions`` is represented by a typeclass,
defining functions such as pdf, cdf, convolve, condition, sample,
log-pdf, etc. \\

Additional type classes will be added for collections of operations.
For example, continuous distribution-specific operations, or
Discrete-specific operations. \\

Each distribution is a parameterized type, for example: \\
\begin{verbatim}newtype Normal = Normal {mu :: Double, sigma :: Double} \end{verbatim}\\
These type declarations will be present in the files under the
Distributions directory. In these files, there will be instance
declarations to make distributions members of certain typeclasses.
